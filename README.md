# SummerUROP

Main Folder for what I'm working on

**1. Archive:** I recently merged projects, so just in case something goes wrong.
**2. HUD:** 
  - Main project here. 
  - Currently working on finishing 2D HUD.
**3. RobotMoverML:** 
  - Used for things that utilize MagicLeap simulation.
  - Had to leave this in a different project because MagicLeap uses a newer and more experimental version of Unity. That version crashes a lot. 
**4. ServerStuff:**
  - Used for debugging purposes 
  - Has a server app that simulates the server that we would use to send/receive information from.
