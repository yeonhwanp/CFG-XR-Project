# Example Scene: PersistentPoint

This examples shows usage of MLPersistentPoint MonoBehaviour which is a utility class that you can attach
to the GameObject and put your virtual objects underneath. It provides some degree of resilience because the component associates
your object with more than one Persistent coordinate frames (PCFs) and improves the chances of restoration on boot.
The two static objects you see in the scene should persist in the same location between device boots.
