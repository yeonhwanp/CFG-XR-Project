# Example Scene: Persistence

This example shows how you can dynamically create objects and persist them by attaching them to the
closest Persistence Coordinate Frame (PCF) in the world. Pressing the bumper creates objects at random
locations and orientations around you.

Althought this example lets you create as many objects as you like, the cost of saving an association between
a virtual object and neighboring PCF is not small. It's recommended that you do this for a few objects in your scene
and child most of your scene under it. For more info refer to the PersistentPoint example.
