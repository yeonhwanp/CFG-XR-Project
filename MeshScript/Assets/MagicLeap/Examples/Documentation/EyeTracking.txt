# Example Scene: Eye Tracking

This example demonstrates the core component EyeTrackingFixationComfort.

The intended use of this component is to ensure the user's fixation point
is at a comfortable distance. When the user observers an area too close,
the component will adjust the near-clip plane gradually. If the user
remains in an uncomfortable state too long, the device will impose a forced
near-clip plane; which is outside of the uncomfortable range.

The UI depicts the following:
- Eye Calibration Status
- Fixation Depth Uncomfortable
- Uncomfortable Remaining Time
- Fixation Depth Violated
