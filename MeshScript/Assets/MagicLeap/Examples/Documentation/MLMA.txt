# Example Scene: MLMA

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input
from a Magic Leap Mobile Application (MLMA).

When a MLMA is connected, this example shows its status. A mobile phone model
shows the state of the buttons and touch input. This model follows your mobile device
with 3 DoF rotational data -- positional data is not available for MLMA.

When an MLMA is disconnected, the example updates the status UI. If a controller is
connected, the status UI also is updated accordingly.

## Bumper - Bottom left button with 2 circles
When you press the Bumper:
- A ring around the bumper button on the mobile phone model lights up.

## Home Button - Bottom middle button with the house icon
When you release the Home Button:
- A ring around the home button on the mobile phone model lights up for a short duration.

## Trigger - Bottom right button with the 4 arrows
When you press the Trigger button:
- A ring around the trigger button on the mobile phone model lights up.
- Note: the trigger value can only be 0 or 1 for the MLMA.

## Touchpad - Grid at the center of the app
When you touch the Touchpad:
- The touchpad on the mobile phone model shows the touch location, similar to what you see on the
  actual MLMA. A maximum of two touches can be detected.

## Keyboard - Tap the keyboard icon on the upper right corner
When you type on the Keyboard:
- Printable characters appear on the keyboard input (left side). Note: you have to tap
  **Submit** on the MLMA.
- The delete key (backspace) removes the last printable character entered. This key does
  not require to tap Submit.
